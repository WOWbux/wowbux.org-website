You must physically write down your seed.  It is possible for the data on your hard drive to go bad and you lose your Wow.  The only way to recover the Wow is by having a physical copy of the seed.  This is easy, find a personal journal or book and using a pen write down the 25 words somewhere they wont be easily spoted by friends.
