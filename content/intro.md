## What is Wow?

![brent_rambo](/brent_rambo.gif)

Wownero is a CPU-mineable memecoin. It is a software fork of Monero with a lite version of RandomX (1MB scratchpad), a ring size of 22, and a faster difficulty adjustment.

Wownero has a deflationary finite supply of 184,467,440 coins with a slow and steady emission over 50 years.

Wownero is a fairly launched coin with no premine, instamine, or dev tax.

## WTF does that mean?

### ORANUS

Every person is a cell of an organism, which is called Economy.

But we call it simply ORANUS. Which translates into Russian as "moutharse".

Each of these cells,

that is, each individual, when regarded as an economic entity -

possesses a kind of social membrane

that allows money to pass into and out of the cell.

This process is controlled by the nervous system of Oranus -

TV and mass media.

Person's identity is gradually displaced

and individual becomes a programme watching another television programme.

There are three types of pulses

transmitted by Oranus throughout its virtual organism:

oral, anal and displacing wow-impulses.

from the commercial ejaculation 'wow!

Homo homini lupus est, as one inspired Latin saying has it.

But man has long ceased being a wolf to man.

Man is not even an image-maker,

not the dealer, not a killer and not an exclusive distributor to man.

as some modern sociologists assume.

It is all far more terrifying and much simpler than that.

Man is wow to man.

Or if not to man, but to precisely another such wow.

So, projected on to the modem system of cultural coordinates

the Latin saying becomes:

Wow Wow Wow!

### A natural born mantra if you put "hum" at the end...

You have seen the technological space in which your world is being consumed by fire.

The fire in which you burn has to be maintained.

And you are one of the service personnel.

That means you are one of those

who force people to gaze into the consuming fire.

You must admit that, it's better to warm yourself by the fire,

than to burn in it.

## WOW mining

[Mining WOW](http://wowbux.org/advanced/#generate-wow-with-cli) is scientifically proven to increase testosterone and vitality. And she'll like it too. Ask Frank Thomas.

Wow! Wow! Wow!

## WOW Scientific and Technological Advanced Research Laboratories 

### A warning for the newly initiated  

The "Three Initiates" who authored WOW choose to remain anonymous. If you are reading this it is because you are meant to be reading this, those who are not ready for the knowledge herein contained should be warned that their minds and reality risk being warped and twisted to such a point that they might loose their minds. Any person with a fragile mind or mental disorder should not embark on this journey. It is for this reason that the WOW research papers are divided into many parts some publically available some hidden behind challenges each diving deeper into not only the technology but the physics, economic principles, cryptographic principles and the information theory underpinning meme culture and WoWs network effect.


### In the begining there were Bits

Most people know about Bitcoin but havnt the faintest clue what a bit is or how it describes the world. Before we can begin a conversation about cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin we must first understand what a Bit truly is and where it came from. Our story begins in 1948, when Bell Labs invented the transistor, that same year Claude Shannon an American mathematician, electrical engineer, and cryptographer published “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” in which he described the shannon (symbol: Sh), more commonly known as the bit "A unit for measuring information". Shannon made his particular detour into a field yet unnamed, strewn with questions and possibilities, which he would soon christen “information theory” and which would go on to become the underlying sensemaking framework of modern consciousness. Shannon, like computing pioneer Alan Turing, was particularly enchanted by the “chain of abstraction and conversion” entailed in cryptography and puzzle-solving. When Turing himself visited Bell Labs in 1943, he occasionally lunched with Shannon and the two traded speculative theories about the future of computing. Shannon’s ideas impressed even a mind as unusual and far-seeing as Turing’s, who marveled about his American friend:

    "Shannon wants to feed not just data to a Brain, but cultural things! He wants to play music to it!"
    
What Shannon had stumbled upon was the ultimate substrate of meaning distilled, counted in bits, information was found to be everywhere. Shannon’s theory made a bridge between information and uncertainty; between information and entropy; and between information and chaos. It led to compact discs and fax machines, computers and cyberspace, Moore’s law and all the world’s Silicon Alleys. Everything we communicate today is in Bits, every telephone call , every song, image, meme and transaction. Money too then is nothing more than information and we will show that information expressed in Bits can be converted to energy or work. 

    "every it — every particle, every field of force, even the spacetime continuum itself — derives its function, its meaning, its very existence entirely — even if in some contexts indirectly — from the apparatus-elicited answers to yes or no questions, binary choices, bits." John Archibald Wheeler (July 9, 1911–April 13, 2008)

It from Bit symbolizes the idea that every item of the physical world has at bottom — at a very deep bottom, in most instances — an immaterial source and explanation; that what we call reality arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions and the registering of equipment-evoked responses; in short, that all things physical are information-theoretic in origin and this is a participatory universe.

    "Physics gives rise to observer-participancy; observer-participancy gives rise to information; and information gives rise to physics." Wheeler

 How just the possession of information might in principle have thermodynamic consequences could be understood through Maxwells demon a thought experiment created by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1867 in which he suggested how the second law of thermodynamics might hypothetically be violated.

    "... if we conceive of a being whose faculties are so sharpened that he can follow every molecule in its course, such a being, whose attributes are as essentially finite as our own, would be able to do what is impossible to us. For we have seen that molecules in a vessel full of air at uniform temperature are moving with velocities by no means uniform, though the mean velocity of any great number of them, arbitrarily selected, is almost exactly uniform. Now let us suppose that such a vessel is divided into two portions, A and B, by a division in which there is a small hole, and that a being, who can see the individual molecules, opens and closes this hole, so as to allow only the swifter molecules to pass from A to B, and only the slower molecules to pass from B to A. He will thus, without expenditure of work, raise the temperature of B and lower that of A, in contradiction to the second law of thermodynamics." 

It was through study of information theory that we now know that it would take more thermodynamic work to gauge the speed of the molecules and selectively allow them to pass through the opening between A and B than the amount of energy gained by the difference of temperature caused by doing so. One of the most famous responses to this question was suggested in 1929 by Leó Szilárd,and later by Léon Brillouin.  Szilárd pointed out that a real-life Maxwell's demon would need to have some means of measuring molecular speed, and that the act of acquiring information would require an expenditure of energy. Since the demon and the gas are interacting, we must consider the total entropy of the gas and the demon combined. The expenditure of energy by the demon will cause an increase in the entropy of the demon, which will be larger than the lowering of the entropy of the gas. What this means for WOW and money is that there is an energy cost to information and information can be used to translate value and energy in a physical system. 

There will always be a cost to mine a WoW and the more mining power in the network, the higher that cost. This cost, ensured by the WOWs network’s Proof-Of-Work algorithm, is as close to a pure energy cost as human activity gets. Once the mining rig is in place it is energy in, scarce token out. If the cost of production exceeds the current price of the token, the miner can just choose to not sell, thereby limiting the supply of WOW in circulation even more and eventually selling them for other goods whenever he so sees fit. In this sense, Wow is a battery. Not only that, but arguably the best battery ever invented. Storing and moving electrical energy had always been costly and wasteful. We haven’t got many efficient ways to do this. WoW offers a way of converting energy into a small part of a specific number. A mathematical battery, if you will. It is important to remember that it does not convert energy into value directly but rather electricity into digital scarcity. Digital scarcity which then can be programmed to express value.

WOWs resistance to ASICs is part of what allows more people to convert energy into value at a comparible scale than with Dodgecoin. If specialized hardware is used there wil be those who have disproportionaly high hashrate to energy consumption and again many additional bits need to be transfered about these shifts in technology and energy effeciency in order for users to calculate the energy from value and vice versa in the system. It is less effecient to determine value than if everyone uses genral purpose machines. 

Energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system as the first law of thermodynamics clearly states. WOW though, can express how much energy that was sacrificed in order to acquire a share of a limited supply. Most importantly because it is ASIC resistant everyone has an equal chance to sacrifice energy at the same scale. You can of course, also acquire WOW by buying them rather than mining them, but in doing so you also spend energy. You somehow acquired the money you bought the WOW with and that somehow came to be because someone sacrificed time and energy somewhere. WOW lets you express that you see that there’s a connection between value and scarcity by sacrificing effort to be a part of the network.


### Money and Communication 

Transactions are a form of communication and every form of communication requires a communication channel in this case the WOW Blockchain. Shannon described "Channel capacity" as the tight upper bound on the rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over a communication channel. In essence the ability to send information with as few bits as possible had its upper limits. In much the same way each economic system is itself a communication channel for value ( information ) with its own upper limits for the rate at which value can be reliably transmitted over the newtork. The current and future distribution of any Fiat currency is not contained in the currency itself ( a dollar does not say how many dollars exist nor how many will be printed ) so in order to transmit the value ( information ) accross the world the sender and receiver need additional information about the money in circulation as well as any changes to monetary policy not to mention a host of other factors such as the stability of the country. All this information has to be transmitted as bits in order to understand the value and covert that information to energy. In contrast it is because the WOW blockchain is constrained to a fixed distribution based on a stable proof of work that when I receive a WOW both the sender and receiver need to transmit fewer Bits in order to extract the energy contained in the value information, they both alreay have the distribution and need not transmit more bits over time because the future distribution and monetary policy is fixed. It is through this measurement of channel capacity and bits that we can weigh the ideal economic system, one which trasmits value fairly across great distances with as few bits as possible. WOW.


### MEME Protections 

MEMES and Network Effect are the most important aspects of electronic cash. It is therefore necessary that the relationship between the user and their memes must be untraceable by  anyone. In particular T.Oak Moot and H.Oath decribe two  properties  which  a  fully  memeable  electronic cash model must satisfy 

Untraceability:
for each incoming Meme all possible memers are equiprobable.

Unlinkability:
for any two outgoing Memes it is impossible to prove they were sent to
the same person

WOW allows a user to publish a single address and receive unconditional unlinkable payments.  The destination of each WOW Output (by default) is a public key, derived from recipient’s address and sender’s random data.  The main advantage against Dogecoin is that every destination key is unique by default (unless the sender uses the same data for each of his transactions to the same recipient).  Hence, there is no such issue as “address reuse” by design and no observer can determine if any transactions were sent to a specific address or link two addresses together.
